  s.description  = <<-DESC
  An implementation of a Persistent Reactive Unidirectional Date Flow using Realm and RxSwift.

  RxStateFlow provides an architecture where the core idea is that your code is built around a `Model` of your application state, a way to `update` your model, and a way to `view` your model.

  Using RxStateFlow makes it very easy to have the app state  persist (between app launches), reactive and accessible across classes and threads.
